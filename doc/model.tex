\title{Model for DES Type Ia Supernova Cosmology Analysis}
\author{Alex Kim}

\section{Model}
We infer a Hubble diagram based on measurements of discovered transients
that have passed some selection criteria (e.g.\ classified as Type~Ia supernovae, SNe~Ia).  The probability distribution
function (pdf) of the Hubble diagram is denoted as
\begin{equation}
p({\mu},{z} |  {{ADU}}, {{T}}_S,{{z}}_S,
{{\theta}}_S, \theta_G, \tau).
\label{hd:eqn}
\end{equation}
The set of distance moduli
and redshifts $(\mu, z)$ contains the points that constitute the Hubble diagram.  The available information
from which the Hubble diagram is inferred include:
the transient photometry ${ADU}$; spectral measurements of
transient
type, redshift and SN-parameters ${T}_S$, ${z}_S$, ${\theta}_S$;
host-galaxy parameter measurements $\theta_H$ (including redshift,
mass, sSFR, etc.).  Only a subset of all detected transients enter the cosmology
analysis: the sample-selection criterion is denoted as $\tau$.  For example
$\tau$ could be the classification score of PSNID.

A sketch of a more extensive model that includes the
model of Equation~\ref{hd:eqn} is depicted in the Probabilistic Graphical Model
(PGM)
shown in Figure~\ref{pgm:fig}.
Note that although we have been discussing the model for the Hubble diagram, the same PGM can
also expresses the pdf for cosmological
parameters, labelled as $\theta_\mu$.

   The forward modeling
   flow goes from left to right, starting with the description of the universe, observatory,
   and data.    A transient has host galaxy $g_i$, which determines its redshift $z_i$
   and galaxy parameters $\theta_{gi}$.
   A distance modulus model with parameters $\theta_\mu$ fix the distance modulus $\mu_i$.
   The transient type $T$ depends on the host-galaxy parameters  $\theta_{gi}$
   and rates $\theta_r$.   The transient
   parameters $\theta_T^X$, $\theta_{Ti}^X$ (and perhaps the host galaxy) determine the luminosity $L$.       The 
   incoming photon flux $n$, $n_g$  are then fixed
   with redshift and distance modulus.
   The instrumental transmission function $\phi$ is calibrated with data ${Z}$ and
   gives the expected
   counts $\overline{\mathit{ADU}}$, $\overline{\mathit{ADU}}_g$. 
   The transient has realized light curves (${ADU}$) and passes selection criteria
   through $\tau_i$ to be included in the sample.  Some transients have spectral data
   ${X}_S$.
   \label{pgm:fig}}
\end{figure}

The fundamental parameters that need to be determined are those with no incoming arrows in Figure~\ref{pgm:fig}.  Most all are used to model the universe: 
the background cosmology, transients that could enter the sample, and their host galaxies.
\begin{itemize}
\item  $g_i$ labels the distinct galaxy that hosts the transient.
\item $\theta_\mu$ are the parameters that specify that distance modulus, e.g.\ the cosmological
parameters.
\item $\theta_\tau$ govern the relative rates of supernovae of different types in galaxies.
\item $\theta_T^{Ia}$, $\theta_{Ti}^{Ia}$.  The model parameters for SNe~Ia, including
parameters that describe distributions.
Different SN~Ia models could be considered: the treatment of SALT2 parameters
has been presented in \citet{2011MNRAS.418.2308M}.
The SALT2 SN~Ia
model has individual $c$ and $x_1$ parameters that would constitute $\theta_{Ti}^{Ia}$,
and global $\alpha$, $\beta$, and intrinsic dispersion  parameters  common to all supernovae
 and  underlying  $c$ and $x_1$ distributions that would constitute $\theta_T^{Ia}$.
\item $\theta_T^{non-Ia}$, $\theta_{Ti}^{non-Ia}$.  Non-Ia transients
that can be mistyped as Ia are described by a parameterized model.
\item The transmission functions $\phi(\lambda)$ describe the optical path from the
atmosphere to counts.  We expect
the calibration group to provide us with the functions and covariance $\phi \sim \mathcal{N}(\bar{\phi},C_\phi)$, in which case it would not have to be determined as part
of our analysis.    There is a chance that we will want to determine calibration ourselves,
so it is included in Figure~\ref{pgm:fig}.
\end{itemize}

From these fundamental parameters we can determine the expected
signals
through a series of intermediary parameters,
some of which are deterministic (points in Figure~\ref{pgm:fig}) and others
probabilistic (ovals).
\begin{itemize}
\item $z_i$, $\theta_{gi}$ are the galaxy redshift and parameters (e.g.\ mass, sSFR, metallicity).
Each galaxy $g_i$ has its values for these quantities.
\item $\mu_i=\mu(z_i; \theta_\mu)$.  The distance modulus is a function of redshift,
whose specific form is unspecified at the moment,  it could
be a $\Lambda$CDM prediction with cosmological parameters, a spline with knot values
as parameters.
The redshift of the galaxy is used in the Hubble diagram.
\item $P(T_i | \theta_r, \theta_{gi})$.  The transient type $T_i$, SN~Ia or non-Ia, depends
on the relative rates given the host properties.  Note that the type is probabilistic.
\item $P(L_i(t,\lambda)| T_i, \theta_T^{Ia}, \theta_{Ti}^{Ia}, \theta_T^{non-Ia}, \theta_{Ti}^{non-Ia},
\theta_{gi})$.  The source model determines
the luminosity; often the model includes intrinsic dispersion making the luminosity
probabilistic. The  model includes  information on the
source and line-of-sight effects, which specify the effective SED.   Only the
parameters of the model of the appropriate type $T$ are relevant.  The galaxy parameters
$\theta_{gi}$ are included if correlations with host-galaxy properties are to be modeled.
\item $n_i(t,\lambda; L_i, \mu_i, z_i)$, $n_{gi}(t; g_i, \mu_i, z_i)$.  The  fluxes of
the transient and host that are incident at Earth
are fixed by the luminosity, distance modulus, and redshift.
\item $\overline{\mathit{ADU}}$ and
$\overline{\mathit{ADU}}_g$ are the expected counts of the transient and galaxy respectively,
coming from $\int n_i \phi d\lambda$.
\end{itemize}

The observations are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item ${\mathit{ADU}}$ is the realized flux. $P({\mathit{ADU}} | \overline{\mathit{ADU}}, 
\overline{\mathit{ADU}}_g)$.
\item $\theta_G$ represents the galaxy parameters of the
galaxy catalog used to identify prospective host galaxies.
The contribution to the likelihood $P(\theta_G|g_i)$ can be
estimated as $P(g_i|\theta_G)\frac{P(\theta_G)}{P(z)}$: Ravi is determining $P(g_i|\theta_G)$.
\item ${T}_S$, ${z}_S$, ${\theta}_S$ Transient type, redshift and properties from
spectroscopic data. I skip the details of the actual measurement  and make a direct association
with the fluxes of the transient and underlying galaxy $n$, $n_g$.
A very simple association is ${T}_S = T$, ${z}_S=z$, ${\theta}_S \in \theta_g$,
or a blurry version instead of a straight equality.
\item $\tau$ is the score used to decide if the transient is used in the analysis.  It is
determined based on other measurements $\tau(\mathit{ADU},T_S)$.
\item ${Z}$ represents the calibration measurements.   Although this may be given
by the Calibration Task Force, the PGM is written for the more general case where the calibration
is modeled within our analysis.
\end{itemize}

%\section{Subsections of the Model}
%
%\subsection{Type}
%\label{type:sec}
%Since our transient sample may not consist purely of SNe~Ia, the model
%has a term of the form $P(T, G | z,\mu)$, which should account for all types of
%objects that could potentially be mistaken for Type~Ia:
%the rates and association with host galaxies are described for
%the full population of potential interlopers.
%This term is not currently well known, particularly at the highest redshifts probed by DES.
%
%An idea is to consider two types: SN~Ia and non-SN~Ia, where the latter's
%intrinsic distributions have loose priors.  Transients that have been spectroscopically
%classified as non-Ia will provide the strongest leverage in constraining the
%contamination: this subset must be unbiased or properly weighted
%relative to the underlying population that constitutes the Hubble diagram.
%Running the model on a pure sample of SNe~Ia can have benefits.
%As discussed in \S\ref{systematics:sec}, comparing these results with
%those from the full sample provides
%a test of systematics.  Alternatively, the non-Ia model may be better constrained
%with the pure sample.
%
%
%To minimize the contribution of non-Ia contamination we strive for
%a pure sample selection so that $P(T=\text{non-Ia}| \mu) \rightarrow 0$.
%
%
%\subsection{Host Matching}
%\sloppy
%The host-galaxy properties depend on the GC and the transient
%coordinates $P({z}_H, {\theta}_H | {\mathit{Gals.}}, \text{RA/Dec})$.  With a
%spectrum of the transient and the underlying background, identification of the host galaxy
%is usually straightforward.
%Otherwise, projections or ambiguous cases can result in the misidentification of
%the host.
%Other supernova surveys (e.g.\ SNLS) 
%with spectroscopically confirmed host associations (e.g.\ with
%matched transient and galaxy redshifts) that replicate the DES population
%can be used to put a prior on this probability.
%
%%An effective way of addressing this term is to
%%analyze the supernovae assuming a correct host match, and
%%experimentally determine $P(\text{mismatch} )$ and
%%$\left. \langle {\mu}-\mu(z)\rangle \right|_{\text{mismatch}}$, $\left. \langle {z}-z \rangle \right|_{\text{mismatch}}$ and cross-terms to correct bias in the Hubble diagram. 
%
%
%% only model $T=\text{SN~Ia}$,
%%and experimentally determine $P(\text{non-Ia})$, 
%%$\left. \langle \mu-\mu_{model} \rangle \right|_{non-Ia}$, and its uncertainty for the
%%sample of non-Ia's that are discovered and misclassified as SN~Ia.
%%This measurement is achieved through spectroscopic
%%typing of a subset drawn from the populations used in the Hubble diagram.
%%The weighted bias would be added as a correction to the Hubble diagram under the assumption that all objects are SNe~Ia.
%
%
%
%\subsection{Type~Ia Supernova Model}
%\label{snmodel:sec}
%The DES light curve analysis in principle may be used for typing and determining
%redshift, in addition to getting supernova properties.   
%Generally the relevant term is
%\begin{equation}
%P({D}_i=1,{\mathit{ADU}}_{i}, {T}_{Si}, {z}_{Si}, {\theta}_{Si}, {z}_{Hi}, {\theta}_{Hi}
% | \mu_i,z_i,T_i,\theta_T,\theta_{Ti},\phi(\lambda)).
% \end{equation}
%Detection and typing depend on the realized light curves, and hence the truncated
%distribution of discovered transients typed as SN~Ia.
%
%The model contains a piece $P({\mathit{ADU}}_{i} {z}_{Si}| \mu_i,z_i,\theta_T, \theta_{Ti}, ,\phi(\lambda))$, which
%is the piece that describes underlying SN~Ia properties and light-curve fits.
%
%
%\subsection{Detection Efficiency}
%There term $P({D}|\mathit{ADU}_V)$.  For all high-redshift supernova searches
%I know of, this depends on the signal-to-noise of the data, and very weakly on the
%structure of the underlying galaxy.  Our detection is now based on machine learning,
%we should confirm that detection dependencies do not depend on our model parameters
%(except for RA/Dec).
%
%\section{Systematic Tests}
%\label{systematics:sec}
%The Hubble diagrams of subsets of data quantify systematic uncertainty.  
%Subsets that may be expected to show evidence for systematics include:
%spectroscopically typed SNe~Ia; transients in deep (3) versus shallow (1/2) DES fields;
%transients with NIR data; splits based on host properties.
%
%A potentially more probative test is to compare the distance moduii inferred for the same
%supernovae, but reducing the amount of data considered.  A subset of DES
%transients have higher signal-to-noise, spectroscopic confirmation, and NIR coverage than
%the average transient, we can take away that extra information in calculating distance modulus
%to get $P(\mu | \mathit{data} - \mu | \mathit{data}^-, z | \mathit{data} - z | \mathit{data}^-)$.
%It is possible that differences in $\mu$s and $z$s have smaller uncertainties that the
%$\mu$ and $z$ alone due to common measurement uncertainties. 
%
%\section{Misc.}
%DES plans a ``photometry''-only analysis, in that a significant subset of transients used
%in the Hubble diagram will not observed spectroscopically while active.  Therefore,
%our model must account for transient mistyping and host-galaxy mismatches.  To obtain
%our targeted
%accuracy we need to account for covariances that occur due to photometric
%calibration and Malmquist bias.  Our model will contain elements that may not
%have been included in previous analyses. 
%
%
%Generically ${{T}}$ can describe sample selection.  I choose to focus
%on objects typed as SN~Ia, rather than  all discovered transients, not just those typed as SN~Ia. 
%The non-Ia transient population has significant model uncertainty and the information they impart on the expansion history is weak:  I anticipate it is cleaner to limit ourselves to
%modeling discoveries we think are SN~Ia. This restriction does not obviate the need
%to consider non-Ia contamination in the sample, rather
%we only need to model non-Ia's
%that are mistaken for Ia and not all discovered transients. 
%
%
%
%Here $\mu$ is modeled; most analyses instead
%directly have cosmological parameters $\{\Omega_M, \Omega_\Lambda, w_0, w_a\}$.
%A motivation is to provide results that can be applied to test arbitrary cosmological models:
%indeed the model-dependence of the $\mu$'s reported for high-$z$ supernovae 
%\citep[e.g.][]{2012ApJ...746...85S} is a source of confusion to the community.
%%An example of a non-parametric model for $\mu$ that is independent of cosmological
%%parameters is given in the Appendix of
%%\citet{2013ApJ...764..116W}.
